# nics [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hadrsystemsteam/nics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hadrsystemsteam/nics)
This repo brings together all the NICS components as submodules to make cloning and building easier when geting started.

To `clone`, use the `recursive` switch:
```git clone --recursive https://github.com/hadrsystemsteam/nics.git```
